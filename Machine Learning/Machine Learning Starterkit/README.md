# Machine_Learning_StarterKit

This was my first challenge in fitting the data into several machine learning models. It was fun!

Motivations
==========
- To validate the machine learning models namely Support Vector Machine (svc), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes using cross-validation and confusion matrix.
- To improve the accuracy on Support Vector Machine (svc) and Random Forest using hyperparameter tuning.

Findings
========
- It has been found that Support Vector Machine (svc) and Random Forest have the highest accuracies compared to the others based on cross-validation and confusion matrix computations.
- It has been found that Support Vector Machine (svc) performs best at C = 1 and gamma = 0.1 and Random Forest at n_estimators = 300.
